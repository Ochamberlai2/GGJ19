From Kianna:

- Some kind of empty inventory slot asset (just some kind of square for when the slot is empty which will be swapped out with the sprite of the collected item);
- Maybe change the animations for the main characters to coming from sprite sheets + add ones for things like eating the apple etc? (mostly for practice);



From Heather:

- A list of events that will need to happen (ideally very granular E.g. Lerp character, teleport character, play animation, display dialogue etc).  
I'm planning on essentially building lists of actions that fire when an event is triggered
